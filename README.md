## 🎯 Mission Statement

This repository documents my systematic approach to mastering Data Structures and Algorithms using JavaScript. Each concept is isolated into focused files with clear examples, time complexity analysis, and practical applications. The goal is **clarity over cleverness** and **consistency over intensity**

> 💡 **Philosophy**: One problem a day compounds fast. Small, consistent progress beats sporadic intensive sessions.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- Basic JavaScript knowledge
- 30 minutes daily commitment

### Installation & Setup

> 🎯 **Pro Tip**: Focus on one concept per session. Quality understanding beats quantity coverage.
